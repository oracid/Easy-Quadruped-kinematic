# Easy-Quadruped-kinematic
KinematicV9.ino is a very simple program to test your quadruped kinematic.
- Consider the Kinematic() function as a black box.
- You have to modify the value of the 3 variables, mySrv, nbFeet, Speed.
- You have to fill the table of your kinematic values. But if you have no idea, you can just use like there are or modify them a little to see what append.
- You must modify the SrvAdjust table. In this table, you can adjust the neutral position(90Â°) of each servo. If no idea, modify with zeros.
- And that's it.
